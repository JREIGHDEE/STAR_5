                <p>This month feels like it <strong>shifted something between us</strong>, like we’ve <strong>grown into each other</strong> more than before. I can’t stop thinking about that Saturday, when the weight of school and everything I’d been holding in finally <strong>broke me down</strong>. I cried in your arms, and in that moment I was <strong>terrified</strong>. Terrified you’d see me differently, maybe even think <strong>less of me</strong> for not being strong enough. But you didn’t. <strong>You just held me, steady, gentle, quiet.</strong> And in that stillness, I realized something I don’t think I’ll ever forget: <strong>I don’t have to hold myself together when I’m with you.</strong> I can fall apart, and <strong>you’ll still love me.</strong></p>
                <p>The way my heart slowed down as soon as you pulled me close… I felt it. That <strong>calm I’ve been searching for</strong>, that <strong>safety I didn’t know I needed</strong>, it was all there in your arms. You didn’t ask me to stop crying, you didn’t try to fix me, you just let me be. And that <strong>meant more than I can ever explain</strong>. That memory is <strong>stitched into me now</strong>.</p>
                <p>Then the week after, it was <strong>you who cried</strong>. You missed me so much that it hurt you, and I could see it in your face, hear it in the way your voice broke. It <strong>shattered something inside me</strong>, because all I wanted was to <strong>take that pain away</strong>. So I held you as tightly as I could, whispered every reassurance I could think of, and promised you that you’ll <strong>never have to be alone</strong> in that feeling. If comforting you meant sitting there all night, I would have done it. If it meant repeating the same words over and over until they sunk in, I would have done it. Because the truth is, I’d <strong>hold you through a thousand storms</strong> if it means being <strong>your safe place.</strong></p>
                <p>I can still see the room as if it’s happening all over again. The <strong>yellow glow</strong> of my lamp shining soft and warm, catching your eyes and making them look like <strong>gold even through your tears</strong>. You held onto me so tightly, and when I told you to follow my lead, you <strong>clung harder and cried more.</strong> My heart cracked in that moment, not in a way that broke me, but in a way that <strong>made me feel everything.</strong> <strong>It hurt to see you hurting, but it also made me certain.</strong></p>
                <p>I want to be the one who holds you through it all, the way you held me. I remember guiding you through grounding. “Five things you can feel. Five things you hear. Five things you can touch.” My voice low, steady, wanting to bring you back to me. And even though you were crying, I knew I was doing what you had done for me, <strong>being the anchor, the calm in the storm.</strong></p>

                <h2 class="entry-title">Yes, yes, yes!</h2>
                <p>I’ve been thinking about the way we say “I love you.” For the longest time, it’s always been a little game between us. You’d tell me, “I love you,” and instead of giving you the real answer you deserved, I’d laugh it off or tease you with a playful “weh?” It was <strong>our thing</strong>, a small piece of our playfulness that I thought was enough to show you how much I cared.</p>
                <p>But then you told me, so gently, that maybe you wanted <strong>a real answer</strong>. That maybe, deep down, you weren’t just joking when you said it. Hearing that <strong>stopped me in my tracks</strong>. It made me wonder if, in all my silliness, I had <strong>failed to show you the depth of what I feel</strong>. That thought <strong>broke me a little</strong>, because the last thing I’d ever want is for you to <strong>doubt how real my love is for you.</strong></p>
                <p>So I decided. <strong>No more jokes when it matters.</strong> No more hiding my love behind laughter. From that day on, when you say “I love you,” I <strong>answer with “yes.”</strong> Not just once, but every time. And when you grin and tease me with “weh?” I’ll still answer “yes.” <strong>Always yes.</strong> Yes, over and over again, <strong>until you feel it the way I mean it.</strong></p>
                <p>It feels different now. Every “yes” is a <strong>promise, a reminder, a confession.</strong> It’s my way of telling you that <strong>I am serious, that I’m here, that I mean it every single time.</strong> And I’ll keep saying it as long as you need me to, because I never want you to doubt it.</p>
                <p>I’d happily trade all those playful “weh, weh, wehs” for “yes, yes, yes” if it means you know, <strong>really know</strong>, that <strong>I’m yours</strong>, and that I love you more than I can put into words. Somehow, it feels even <strong>sweeter this way</strong>. It feels like us <strong>growing, becoming softer</strong> with each other, opening ourselves in ways we never thought we would.</p>
                <p>And the truth is, I don’t think I’ll <strong>ever get tired of saying yes to you</strong>. <strong>Yes to your love. Yes to us. Yes to every single day we get to spend together.</strong></p>

                <h2 class="entry-title">Mistranslated</h2>
                <p>Tonight left me with a lot to think about. We were just on call, laughing and talking, when you asked me to translate a word from Gaelic to English. At first, I joked about being wary of translations because of what happened before, when Paul once made me translate something that ended up being <strong>ugly instead of sweet</strong>. It was a stupid memory that came out of my mouth in passing, and I realize now how that must have sounded to you.</p>
                <p>When you teased me back, saying it was like I <strong>compared you to him</strong>, I laughed along at first, but truthfully it <strong>sat in my chest differently</strong>. It bothered me, because even in the smallest ways, I <strong>cannot bear the thought</strong> of you believing I would ever see you the same way I saw him. The truth is, <strong>you are everything he was not.</strong> You are <strong>light where he was dark, warmth where he was cold.</strong> You are the reason I even feel <strong>safe enough to love this openly again</strong>. So yes, it <strong>hurt a little</strong> to hear the comparison, even as a joke, because the last thing I want is for you to think I would put you anywhere near the same page as him.</p>
                <p>And then the word translated, and it was not ugly at all. <strong>It was “I love you.”</strong> I knew, even before the screen told me so, that <strong>I could trust what you were saying.</strong> I did not doubt you for a second, because I know <strong>your love is real</strong>. And maybe that is why it stung, because I <strong>care so much about how I hold you in my life</strong>, and I never want you to think I would question that love.</p>
                <p>I am sorry if I got quiet after. I think I was <strong>shy, trying to gather my feelings</strong>, trying not to let the heaviness linger when what I really wanted was to hold onto the <strong>sweetness of the moment</strong>. It is true that translating words feels like a sensitive spot for me, but <strong>you turned it into something different, something soft, something full of love.</strong> I did not expect to feel that, and it <strong>caught me off guard in the best way.</strong></p>
                <p>So let me put it here plainly, where there is <strong>no joke and no room for doubt.</strong> I love you. I love you so much that it <strong>aches a little</strong> to even think of you being compared to someone who once hurt me. You mean too much, you have given me too much, and you are too precious to ever be placed in the same breath as him. <strong>You are my comfort, my joy, my home.</strong></p>
                <p>Sometimes I wonder if you realize just <strong>how much space you take up in me</strong>. It is in the way I smile when I see your name light up my phone. It is in the way I feel lighter just hearing your voice, even if we are only talking for a short while. Loving you feels like <strong>breathing</strong>, and I do not think I will ever tire of telling you, again and again, how much you mean to me.</p>
                <p>So when you say “I love you,” know that <strong>I believe you with every part of me.</strong> And when I say it back, it is not just words, <strong>it is my heart choosing you, over and over, in every moment, in every way.</strong></p>

                <h2 class="entry-title">Cold Coffees</h2>
                <pre>
I love my coffee cold and mild,
A <strong>comfort sip</strong>, a moment styled.
But <strong>you are heat, both bold and bright,</strong>
A <strong>burning flame</strong> in the quiet night.

Each drop of you, I’d <strong>drink it slow,</strong>
A <strong>steady love</strong> that’s sure to grow.
No rush, no haste, just time and care,
A <strong>warmth that lingers everywhere.</strong>

Your touch’s like steam upon my skin,
A <strong>gentle fire that glows within.</strong>
And just like coffee, strong and sweet,
You make my world feel <strong>whole, complete.</strong>

Through every sip, through every day,
Your love’s the brew that <strong>lights my way.</strong>
No cup compares, no blend can be,
As <strong>rich and deep</strong> as you are to me.

So here’s my vow, as soft as song,
To <strong>savor you my whole life long.</strong>
For love like yours is <strong>rare to find,</strong>
A <strong>perfect blend of heart and mind.</strong>

The night is quiet, the sky aglow,
A <strong>gentle warmth</strong> the stars bestow.
Each thought drifts softly <strong>back to you,</strong>
Turning the dark to <strong>something new.</strong>

I’d <strong>cross the distance, break the tide,</strong>
With every step <strong>right by your side.</strong>
And in that glow, <strong>so clear, so true,</strong>
<strong>Look how they shine for you.</strong>
